in this work, i tried to predict cholesterol levels using variables like Age, smoking factor and blood pressure. 
The dataset used contains this 3 variables and multiple linear regression using Statsmodel in python was used for the 
analysis. Correlation analysis was first done to ascertain the level of effect between the three variables and i 
discovered that there is positive correlation between cholesterol level and blood pressure wuth value of 0.6 Also there's 
a weak positive correlation between blood pressure and Age which signifies 
that the relationship between them is minimal and may not have strong practical significance. For blood pressure and cholesterol level, 
it's significant.

in the second pics, shows the results of the regression analysis
